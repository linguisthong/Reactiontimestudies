# Reaction time studies
Reaction time studies in psychology use methods to measure a person's reaction time to different types of stimuli. These studies are meaningful because they allow researchers to experiment their theories with human subjects by observing human response. 

Researchers in the field of linguistics have also adapted reaction time methods to test their theories, arguing that these methods provide insight into a person's "internal grammar system" or "implicit knowledge" rather than their conscious use of grammar. One challenge of conducting linguistic experiments, as with other social sciences, is that participants' responses may not always reflect their true cognitive processes due to masking or avoidance behaviors. For example, when assessing a person's writing skills through open-ended responses, it is difficult to measure their underlying grammatical system because they may consciously choose alternative words to avoid potential mistakes. Similarly, controlled tasks like fill-in-the-gap exercises may mitigate such avoidance, but these methods often lack face validity since they do not accurately reflect real-life language use.
